  # Fix RLS Policies for Sections and Bottle Packages

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies on `sections` and `bottle_packages`
    - Add new policies that allow public (anon) users to manage sections and packages
    - This allows the admin interface to work without authentication while still having RLS enabled
  
  2. Security
    - Tables remain protected by RLS (enabled)
    - Public users can view, insert, update, and delete (necessary for admin panel functionality)
    - Consider adding API key validation or IP restrictions at the application level for production
